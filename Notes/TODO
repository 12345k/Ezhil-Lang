+ add lexical scoping of variables instead of Matlab like
  dynamic scoping/carry-over which IMHO sucks / buggy
+ add arrays, variable arguments, lists, dictionaries
  --array types need strong type checking, matching
  indices, and intializing the types.
+ add higher order function, and if possible closures
+ write eval, and apply in exprs
+ correctly implement the interactive interpreter for
  multiple lines using a '\' or '...' line extension
+ implement a type-checking visitor before eval.
+ Pretty print the parse prints...
+ Use the visitor pattern for C, 8085, evaluation
+ Write a debugger, and profiler based on visitor
+ Compile to python bytecode through Python compiler AST
  building transformation OR direct generation.
+ Try converting to a simple internal VM format, and write
  a VM engine, and peephole optimizations
