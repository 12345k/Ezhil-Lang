Q. Help, I cannot use Ezhil from the console! I installed Ezhil from the github repository.
   Even the GNOME Terminal, Windows CMD, KDE Konsole terminal software don't render Tamil text.
   How can I now learn/use Ezhil ?

Answer:
   Short answer: you need the single-page Ezhil web app.
   
   You have installed Konsole correctly; even though this software works well for Tamil, compared to Gnome Terminal, it still has problems.

   My recommendation is to use Ezhil via your localhost via the web-browser; do the following steps,

   1. Navigate to the root directory of Ezhil project
     $ cd ezhil-lang/ 

   2. Start the webserver
     $ ./webserver.sh

   3. Open firefox or chrome and navigate to URL for the Ezhil web-app:
      http://localhost:8080/

   This page will have your Ezhil online browser where you can type programs.

   You can type the code in the text box and enter to evaluate the program. The output will be
   shown in the new webpage. This page contains your output and/or error messages, and also allows you
   to navigate backwards to enter a newer program or view the older code.
